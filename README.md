# Introduction (point get clear in hash & maps)
Hi, I’m Rohit Dorage, a full-stack engineer from Pune, India.  
I specialize in React, Node.js, and Golang, and have built production apps like an Electron uploader handling terabyte-scale files, and scalable AWS infrastructure using Pulumi.  
I’m passionate about building efficient systems, clean code, and solving client problems with the best technology choices.

## string 
a string is a primitive data type used to represent textual data. It is a sequence of characters, which can include letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.

## array 
an array is a single variable used to store an ordered collection of multiple values, known as elements. These elements are assigned a numerical position, called an index, which starts at 0 for the first element, 1 for the second, and so on.

# DSA points
